# Machine learning and feature selection for undestanding the most important features in predicting homicide rate in brazilian cities
## 1) Business Understanding
### 1.1) Business Context
Urban violence is a problem faced in many parts of the world, in which historical, political, cultural and economic issues contribute to its increase.
One of the most used indicators to measure violence is the homicide rate, which is the number of homicides that occur in a year for every 100,000 inhabitants. According to the annual report by the Mexican NGO Seguridad, Justicia y Paz (2021), of the 50 municipalities with the highest homicide rates in the world, 11 are Brazilian, which reinforces how the country still lacks measures aimed at solving this issue. .
### 1.2) Objective
In order to offer a better understanding of this problem and provide information to help the decision-making process in public safety, the present work carries out an investigation using mathematical and statistical techniques, in order to identify which are the most important metrics in predicting the homicide rate of Brazilian municipalities.

## 3) Roadmap
For the future I intend to test Causal Inference techniques to measure the evidence of causality between the independent variables and the dependent variable
